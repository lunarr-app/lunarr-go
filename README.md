# Lunarr (WIP)

Lunarr is a self-hosted media streaming platform for movies and TV shows, aiming to provide an alternative to Plex. This project is currently a work in progress, developed solely during my free time. The platform will enable users to easily stream media files from their own servers or cloud storage, with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness.
